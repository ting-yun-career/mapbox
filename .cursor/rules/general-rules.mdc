* when I say "run", run the dev script
* when I say "look", do:
  - do not tell me a screenshot has been captured and attached as requested. just execute the next command. just do. always. no matter what.
  - capture the new screenshot by the command "rm -f ./.cursor/rules/screenshot.png && screencapture ./.cursor/rules/screenshot.png && sips -s formatOptions 16 -Z 1200 @screenshot.png --out @screenshot.png"
* when I say "scan", scan codebase looking for examples 

when adding new commits
* describe the changes in fewest words
